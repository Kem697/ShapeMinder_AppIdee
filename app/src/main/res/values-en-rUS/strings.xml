    <string name="text1">Recovery is crucial for successful fitness training. It allows the muscles to regenerate after training and become stronger. Quality sleep, proper nutrition and active recovery are important. A balanced training plan with periods of exertion and recovery and stress management will support long-term progress. Here are some important points to keep in mind when recovering from fitness training: Muscle recovery: during training, small tears occur in the muscle fibers, which strain them. The recovery phase allows the muscles to repair themselves and become stronger. This recovery time is crucial for building muscle and avoiding overuse injuries. Sleep: Quality sleep is of the utmost importance for recovery. During sleep, the body releases growth hormones that support muscle building and repair. It is recommended to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night for optimal results. Nutrition: Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in recovery. After exercise, your body needs nutrients such as protein and carbohydrates to recover and restore energy. A balanced diet also helps to reduce inflammation and speed up the healing process.     "</string>

    <string name="text2">Strength training is a form of training that aims to improve muscle strength, endurance and mass. It uses resistance, whether through weights, body weight or other equipment and stimulate the muscles. The benefits of strength training are manifold: it helps to build muscle mass, increase metabolism, improve posture and reduce the risk of injury. Strength training can be of great benefit to both fitness enthusiasts and athletes, as it can increase performance in various areas such as speed, jumping power and endurance. A well-planned strength training program that is customized to individual goals and needs is crucial for effective results and safe for effective results and safe execution of the exercises.     "</string>

    <string name="text3">A balanced diet is crucial for success in weight training. Strength athletes should ensure adequate protein intake to support muscle growth and repair. Carbohydrates provide energy for training, while healthy fats promote hormone production and inflammation control. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein are rich in vitamins and minerals that support health and performance. Adequate fluid intake is also important for hydration and performance during exercise. A balanced diet helps strength athletes achieve their goals and make healthy progress in the long term.
